# Corporate Earnings data from corporate SEC filings.

A key idea in value investing is that we should evaluate potential investment candidates in terms of their merits as a business, rather their stock price action.
This requires comparative analysis of data from the earning reports of different businesses.
This page provides a tool to do just that. 

The data comes from US corporate earnings reports, which are available in a reasonably organized form from the SEC EDGAR database: https://www.sec.gov/edgar.


## To do:
- are there adsh values that don't have a corresponding entry in the subs table?
- handling multiple submissions 
- handling multiple methods for reporting the same data
- database indexing improvements

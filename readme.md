# Corporate Earnings data from corporate SEC filings.

A key idea in value investing is that we should evaluate potential investment candidates in terms of their merits as a business, rather their stock price action.
This requires comparative analysis of data from the earning reports of different businesses.
This page provides a tool to do just that. 

The data comes from US corporate earnings reports, which are available in a reasonably organized form from the SEC EDGAR database: https://www.sec.gov/edgar. However, not that despite efforts to standardize accounting practices, there will always be differences in reporting practices, so the data should be manually checked against the original reports (linked) before any serious decisions are made.


## To do:
- are there adsh values that don't have a corresponding entry in the subs table?
- handling multiple submissions 
- handling multiple methods for reporting the same data
- database indexing improvements
- check data for the early years: seems sparse
